# SwiftCodeWars

Scratch work files for solving Code Wars projects

CodeWars is website that I use to stay sharp and practice in Swift, Java, and C#.

This folder contains a workspace with a few examples of tasks from that website.

The examples here will all be in Swift.

They are all written as playground files, which will need to be opened in XCode on a Mac.
